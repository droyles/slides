Why is the subtitle \u201cPower and the Production of History\u201d? What is the relationship among power, history, and silences? note: - emphasizes silencing as an act and a process (i.e., a verb) rather than silence as a thing (i.e., a noun)\u2014makes clear that there is a subject doing the silencing, regardless of whether the silencing is intentional - \"the past\" exists in its relationship to \"the present\" (15) What are \u201chistoricity 1\u201d and \u201chistoricity 2\u201d? Why are they important to what Trouillot is trying to say? note: historicity 1 = historical process / that which happened according to Trouillot, the positivist school of historical thinking (which he sees as normative in academic history) focuses on historicity 1 without considering the role of the historian as narrator and interpreter; is to some degree invested in \"objectivity\" historicity 2 = historical narrative / that which is said to have happened according to Trouillot, the constructivist school of historical thinking (which he associates with Hayden White and postmodernists) says that everything is narrative and facts are illusory or irrelevant Trouillot's intervention is to say that a) something happened and b) how we narrate / what we can know about what happened is both important and always already shaped by the operation of power at various levels of the historical process the two historicities are not totally coincident but do overlap, and \u201cthe more serious task\u201d that emerges from recognizing this is to determine \u201cnot what history is\u2026 but how history works\u201d\u2014and determines that history works through power (25) How does power inhere in the production of historical knowledge? note: - through silencing, which is the opposite and flipside of mentioning, and enters in at four stages (26): - \u201cfact creation\u2026 making of sources \u201d - \u201cfact assembly\u2026 making of archives \u201d - \u201cfact retrieval\u2026 making of narratives \u201d - \u201cretrospective significance\u2026 making of history in the final instance\u201d - how is he using each of these terms? what kinds of sources and archives is he talking about, for instance? - these is theoretical language, and he's talking in the abstract, so historical \"facts\" or \"sources\" include the crumbling ruins of Sans Souci-Milot and \"archives\" includes any assmblage of \"facts,\" but also \u201ca tourist guide, a museum tour\u201d and more (52) Why does Trouillot devote two chapters to a discussion of Haiti? What does he have to say, both about power and the production of history inside Haiti and power and the production of history about Haiti? Trouillot devotes the final full chapter to a discussion of Columbus Day\u2014why? What does he have to say about Columbus and Columbus Day? How does Columbus Day relate to what he has to say about Haiti? Trouillot refers to academic history as a \u201cguild.\u201d Why might he have chosen to describe the profession in this way? note: - focuses our attention on the ways that the norms of academic history shape the knowledge that we create - also denaturalizes those norms by highlighting that they are created and perpetuated by people (mainly white men!) - and by referencing a \"guild\" makes those norms seem kind of weird and outdated\u2014 provincializes them - \"A fetishism of the facts, premised on an antiquated model of the natural sciences, still dominates history and the other social sciences.\" (151) - and indeed we should think critically about the way we do our work - also makes historians sound somewhat insular and rarefied - \"Academic historians tend to keep as far away as possible from the historical controversies that most move the public of the day.\" (151) - worth pointing out both that Trouillot was painting with a broad brush, but also that a lot has changed in the last ~30 years about the ways that historians both practice their craft, in part because several generations of historians have been trained in part by reading Trouillot , the scholars who influenced him, and the scholars that he influenced - i.e., it's not just Trouillot, there's a whole postcolonial turn in history that was transformative - we can also see lots of examples of publicly engaged historians today, along with more and more venues for historians to publish their work for audiences outside of the academy, although this is thanks to the internet, which has also introduced a lot of... questionable content into the public sphere What might Trouillot say in response to the piece by Sweet that we read last week? note: - the historian is never a neutral narrator - all the distortions of historical memory that Sweet describes (a tour guide at Elmina who molds his narrative to what he thinks African American tourists want to hear, Hollywood films that play fast and loose with historical fact for dramatic effect, disingenuous SCOTUS judges) have their own histories - the way that Sweet talks about both Elmina and the United States in the history of Atlantic slavery fits into the \"formula of banalization\" that Trouillot describes\u2014suggests that horrific history was marginal or incidental to larger, more important story - How can we think about the silences that Trouillot talks about in terms of our work on the A People\u2019s Guide to Miami ? \u00b6 Recommended Readings \u00b6 Hayden V.
